We want to implement the algorithm proposed by this paper https://proceedings.mlr.press/v206/maiti23a/maiti23a.pdf
We have coded the functions required to implement the algorithms, one can check if actually the bound on T described in the paper works or not by checking nash equilibrium of a matrix and nash equilibrium obtained by sampling matrices.
